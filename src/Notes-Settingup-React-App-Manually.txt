   taken from github go to  SECTION 2: HOW TO TEST REACT WITH JEST:  
================================================
  Section 1: 
    - Create javaScript project from scratch
    - Setup Webpack 5
    - Setup Webpack 5 with Babel
===============================================
1. First let's create an Javascript app manually 
     - md   C:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder15-configure-manually-created-react-to-use-RTL
     - cd   C:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder15-configure-manually-created-react-to-use-RTL
     - npm init -y
 
     - Now, since you have used npm to initialize it, your project should have a package.json file which should be 
     filled with your defaults. 

     - let us setup folder structure 
         md src
         md dist

      - create index.js in ./src. add the following content:
          console.log ("Hello Project");

      - navigate to your project root and run index.js:
          node src/index.js

      - "Hello Project" should appear in the command line

      - Add scripts to package.json
          - now instead of running  "node src/index.js" this time 
            run it with "npm start"
          "Hello Project" should appear in the command line

    Congratulationd we have setup our first Javasript project.

2. Because this is not using boilerplate project (I created it manually) 
   OTHERWISE go to Section 2: Setup Webpack 5 in the boilerplate project: 

   - Click custom React setup - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/
   and scroll down to Table of Contents and implement: 

      1. React with Babel - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#react-with-babel
        So far, you should have the following folder structure for your JavaScript application 
        that uses Webpack and Babel:
         - node_modules/
            - dist/
            -- index.html
            - src/
            -- index.js
            - package.json
            - webpack.config.js
            
      2. React with Webpack - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#react-with-webpack
          - in order to use React, you need two libraries (node packages): react and react-dom. 
          Install them on the command line from your project's root folder:

            npm install --save react react-dom
          
          - In your src/index.js, you can implement your entry point into the React world:
            See code that was pasted  in.

          - go to dist/index html and paste in code from tutorial (see comments in index.html)

          - finally do npm start. 
            You should be able to see the output of your React implementation in your browser.
            The implementation for now is you will see "React with Webpack and Babel"
                 React implementation insert src/index.js

      3. Hot Module Replacement in React  - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#hot-module-replacement-in-react

         - A huge development boost will give you react-hot-loader (Hot Module Replacement). 
         It will shorten your feedback loop during development. Basically whenever you change 
         something in your source code, the change will apply in your app running in the browser 
         without reloading the entire page. First, install it from your project's ROOT DIRECTORY 
         on the command line:

            npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader --legacy-peer-deps

         - Second, add the configuration to your webpack.config.js file: 
             const webpack = require('webpack');
             plugins: [new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()],
         - Third add to src/index.js 
             module.hot.accept();

         Now you can start your app again. Once you change your title for the React 
         component in the src/index.js file, you should see the updated 
         output in the browser without any browser reloading.

   - Last but not the least , create your first React component. In your src/index.js file, import a 
     not yet defined App component:  

         cd src/
         touch App.js
     And add the following content in it:

      import React from 'react';

      const App = ({ title }) =>
      <div>{title}</div>;

      export default App;

     Congratulations, you have created your first function component and passed props to it. 
     That's it for a minimal React setup with Babel and Webpack. Let me know your
     thoughts and whether there are things to improve the setup. You can find the

   Section 2: Testing with JEST + React Testing Library (RTL) 
   After doing Section 1: (by clicking custom React setup)
   Click CONTINUE READING: JEST WITH REACT TESTING LIBRARY 
   The link is https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-jest/
    (HOW TO TEST REACT WITH JEST)
==============================================
 1. Setup JEST
   - Scroll down to "JEST Testing in React Setup" 

   - copy the following to src/index.js 
        import React from 'react';
         import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

         import App from './App';

       ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));

   - copy and add the following code block to src/app.js (including import statements)
            "Export const dataReducer ..... to export default App
         if no App.js create with: touch App.js from ./src
         

      - the code block uses Axios to fetch data so install axios
                  npm install axios 

      - In order to get our tests up and running, set up Jest by installing it on the 
      command line as development dependencies:
            npm install --save-dev jest --force 

         then add to package.json script section: 
            "test": "jest --config ./jest.config.json"

         then define jest.config.json in Project Root
            touch jest.config.json

         add the following pattern to jest.config.json
            {
               "testRegex": "((\\.|/*.)(spec))\\.js?$"
               }
         create a test file called: App.spec.js
            touch src/App.spec.js

         implement your test suite in App.spec.js

      - now run your test 
         npm start 
         npm run test -- --watch

 2. Scroll down to "Jest Snapshot Testing in React"
      - Jest introduced the so-called Snapshot Test. Basically a Snapshot Test creates a 
      snapshot -- which is stored in a separate file -- of your rendered component's 
      output when you run your test. This snapshot is used for diffing it to the next 
      snapshot when you run your test again.

      - By using Jest for Snapshot Tests, you can keep your tests lightweight, without 
      worrying too much about implementation details of the component

      - First, install the react-test-renderer utility library commonly used for Jest to
      render your actual component in your tests:
            npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer

      - Second implement your first Snapshot Test with Jest (see notes in App.spec.js)

 3. Scroll down to "Jest Unit/Integration Testing in React:"
      
      - In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning, and has switched 
      to concurrent rendering. We recommend migrating your tests to @testing-library/react 
      or @testing-library/react-native for a modern and well supported testing experience.

      - Add reducer hook test suite in App.spec.js (See notes)

 4. Exercises:
      - Check out the advanced Webpack setup - https://www.robinwieruch.de/webpack-advanced-setup-tutorial/
        Put it into your minimal React with Webpack application
        Confirm your final result with the official advanced React with Webpack setup



==============================================
   Section 3:  
==============================================
   1. We are using Webpack to generate one JavaScript bundle from 
      all our source code in the src/ folder, which will
      your dist/ folder afterward. Then, it can be used in our entry point HTML file 
      the following way:
      
         <script src="./bundle.js"></script>

   2.  Web Pack Setup
         You will use Webpack to bundle your JavaScript source code, but also to 
      add advanced features to build your project with further build steps later on. 
      Moreover, you will use the Webpack Dev Server to serve your project in a local 
      environment with a local web server for development purposes. Last but not least, 
      you need the Webpack CLI as well. Let's install all three dependencies as libraries 
      (node packages) by using npm for your project. From your project's root directory, type:
      
         npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli
         
      As a side effect, you should find a node_modules/ folder with all your third party 
      dependencies.

      Run your npm start script on the command line again, however, this time you have Webpack 
      as local web server to serve your files in development mode


   3. How to Webpack 5 with Babel - Setup Tutorial - https://www.robinwieruch.de/webpack-babel-setup-tutorial/
         By using Babel, the code which isn't supported yet, will get transpiled back to vanilla 
      JAVASCRIPT so that every environment (e.g. browser) can interpret it. In order to get Babel 
      running, you need to install two of its main dependencies on the command line:
   
            npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env

      - Moreover, in case you have Webpack in place to bundle your JavaScript application, you will have to 
         install a Webpack Loader for Babel:

            npm install --save-dev babel-loader

      - Now we need to modify PACKAGE.JSON 
            "babel": {
                  "presets": [
                     "@babel/preset-env"
                  ]
               },
      
         and WEBPACK.CONFIG.JS - webpack.config.js file needs to include Babel in its build process as well. 
         There, make use of the previously installed Loader for Babel. You need to tell Webpack on which files 
         to use the loader (e.g. .js files) and optionally which folders to exclude from the 
         process (e.g. node_modules):

      - An optional step would be to extract your Babel configuration into a separate 
         .babelrc configuration file. 
         You can create this file in your project's root directory on the command line:

            touch .babelrc
            
         Add configuration for bael. 
            {
               "presets": [
                  "@babel/preset-env"
               ]
               }

         - Babel enables you to use future JavaScript features in your browser, because 
         it TRANSPILES IT DOWN TO VANILLA JAVASCRIPT. Try it yourself by installing your 
         first plugin. Make sure to see that the JavaScript feature doesn't work at first 
         in your src/index.js file, but once you installed the plugin for the feature and 
         integrated it in your .babelrc file, it should be possible to run the JavaScript 
         source code.

         Try out a Babel Plugin yourself
         Install a Babel Plugin via npm to your project to support an upcoming 
         JavaScript feature

   4. How to use ESLint in Webpack 5 - Setup Tutorial - https://www.robinwieruch.de/webpack-eslint/
      npm install --save-dev eslint

   5. Scroll down to ESLint + Webpack + Babel - https://www.robinwieruch.de/webpack-eslint/
      npm install --save-dev eslint-webpack-plugin

      touch .eslintrc then add:
         {
            "rules":{}
         }
         
      Next, you can use the new Webpack plugin for ESLint in your Webpack 
      webpack.config.js file:

      npm install --save-dev @babel/eslint-parser 
      then in .eslintrc add:
         touch .eslintrc then add:
         {
            "parser": "@babel/eslint-parser",
            "rules":{}
         }

   =======================================================
      - go to https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#react-with-babel

      1.  npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react 
      modify .babelrc - insert "@babel/preset-react"

      2. Next, let's inform Webpack in our webpack.config.js file about files with the
      JSX extension to make sure that they run through the transpiling step as well:

      Insert the following in webpack.config.js:
         Rules Section: 
            test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
         Resolve Section: 
               extensions: ['*', '.js', '.jsx'],

         That's it for enabling React in JavaScript by using Babel and Webpack. We are 
         allowed to write React with JSX now.

      3. In order to use React, you need two libraries (node packages): react and react-dom. 
         Install them on the command line from your project's root folder:

            npm install --save react react-dom

      4. In your src/index.js, you can implement your entry point into the React world:
               import React from 'react';
               import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

               const title = 'React with Webpack and Babel';

               ReactDOM.render(
               <div>{title}</div>,
               document.getElementById('app')
               );

      5. Add to dist/index.html file:
            <div id="app"></div>

         do npm start 
         You should be able to see the output of your React implementation in your browser.

      6. Scroll down to Hot Module Replacement in React

         npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader

         Second, add the configuration to your webpack.config.js file:
            const webpack = require('webpack');
            Plugin Section:
                  plugins: [new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()]
            Dev Server Section:
               hot: true
         Third:
               Additionally in the src/index.js file, you have to define
            that hot reloading is available and should be used:   
               module.hot.accept();

            Start the app Once you change your title for the React component in the src/index.js file, 
         you should see the updated output in the browser without any browser reloading. 
         
            Last but not least, create your first React component. In your src/index.js file, 
         import a not yet defined App component

         Next create App.js in ./src using touch App.js and then add the following:

               import React from 'react';

               const App = ({ title }) =>
               <div>{title}</div>;

               export default App;

            Congratulations, you have created your first function component and passed props
            (e.g ({title}))  to it. 

         That's it for a minimal React setup with Babel and Webpack. Let me know your thoughts 
         and whether there are things to improve the setup. You can find the repository on GitHub.


      
      
   =============================================
  SECTION 2: HOW TO TEST REACT WITH JEST - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-jest/
=============================================
  
     - Setup Project File/Folder structure
         mkdir dist
         cd dist
         touch index.html
     - add content to index.html/ - this file contains all the HTML to 
     display your website in a browser. No JavaScript is involved yet. 
     In order to get you started with JavaScript, put the following logging 
     in a src/index.js file: console.log('Hello Webpack Project.');

     - As for now, you should have dist/ and src/folder for your project
         - dist/  (everything you need to take your application to production on a web server sits in the dist/ folder)
            -- index.html
         - src/   (everything to implement your application sits in the src/ folder.)
            -- index.js
         - package.json 
  
     - add this to dist/index.html: <script src="./bundle.js"></script>
       We need to bundle stuff in ./src so we will need to setup web pack.

         (1) npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli (from root)

             After installation as a side effect node_modules/folder with all third
             party dependencies are installed. Check package.json to see dependencies
         
         (2) In your package.json change the start script to: 
               "start": "webpack serve --mode development",

         (3) You can run your npm start script on the command line again, however, 
         this time you have Webpack as local web server to serve your files in 
         development mode. Navigate to your dist/index.html file to see its output 
         in the browser. 

         (4) Let’s create the required webpack.config.js file in your project's root 
         directory: touch webpack.config.js

         (5) Finish the Webpack setup by adding this content to webpack.config.js

4. Finally setup Webpack 5 with Babel -https://www.robinwieruch.de/webpack-babel-setup-tutorial/
     
    - Babel enables one writing code with JavaScript features that aren't supported 
    by most browser yet. Perhaps you have heard about JavaScript ES6 (ES2015), ES7, 
    and other versions of ECMAScript specification which are up and coming for the 
    JavaScript language.

    - By using Babel, the code which isn't supported yet, will get transpiled back 
    to vanilla JavaScript so that every environment (e.g. browser) can interpret it. 
    In order to get Babel running, you need to install two of its main dependencies 
    on the command line:

       npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env

   - Moreover, in case you have Webpack in place to bundle your JavaScript application, 
   you will have to install a Webpack Loader for Babel:  

       npm install --save-dev babel-loader

   - Now, with all libraries (node packages) in place, you need to adjust your 
   package.json and webpack.config.js (if necessary) to respect the Babel changes.
   These changes will include all packages you have installed before. 

   First, in your package.json, include the Babel Preset:
        "babel": {
            "presets": [
               "@babel/preset-env"
            ]
         },
    
    Second, your webpack.config.js file needs to include Babel in its build process 
    as well. There, make use of the previously installed Loader for Babel. You need 
    to tell Webpack on which files to use the loader (e.g. .js files) and optionally 
    which folders to exclude from the process (e.g. node_modules): 

    You can do "npm start" again. Nothing should have changed except for that you can 
    use upcoming ECMAScript features for JavaScript now. An optional step would 
    be to extract your Babel configuration into a separate .babelrc configuration 
    file. You can create this file in your project's root directory on the 
    command line:
          
          touch .babelrc

    Then, add the configuration for Babel -- which you have previously added in 
    your package.json -- in the .babelrc file. Don't forget to remove the configuration 
    in the package.json afterward. It should be configured only once.
  
    Exercises: 
       - install Babel Plugin via npmto support upcoming javascript feature
         https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins

         Example: npm add babel-plugin-import (A plugin that can be used to add a library)
                   Add the Plugin to your .babelrc file
